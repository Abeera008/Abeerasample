 ✍️ Writing Portfolio by Abeera

Welcome to my writing portfolio! I'm a passionate student and freelance writer with experience in creating engaging content, product descriptions, blog articles, and social media copy.

📚 About Me
I'm currently a student with a focus on content writing, copywriting, and digital media. This repository showcases my writing samples and my content planning system using Google Sheets.

📁 What You'll Find Here:
- Blog post outlines
- Sample articles
- Product description samples
- A sample content calendar (Google Sheet link below)

 📊 Content Planner (Google Sheets)
To stay organized, I use a custom content planner made in Google Sheets. It helps me track topics, deadlines, and client feedback.
